## [Examples and source for the "idea"](#source)
This is how I can claim it is not my fault, someone-else had already tried it...

Riffing off of Marcel Duchamp's "fountain" and Jaume Plensa's "Crown Fountain", the idea of a urinal pouring out at the audience seemed obvious and didn't require a lot of reflection.

## [Initial Sketchy Ideas](#sketch)
 
I havent used CAD since the 1990's and this is one of the few times I have tried to use a non-CAD tool to create a CAD object

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; "    />


I did not have a pen at the time, and I thought I would test myself to hack Apple's Preview PDF viewer to create an image.  There is no way to create a new image, I first created a screen-shot, then pasted white over everything making a 'canvas'. After that used the basic stencile tools to create the shapes.  "success" 

 

## [The end](#the-end)

But all things must come to and end, even visual torture will cease once you



### [Why this idea was doomed to fail](#ultimate-fail) <span style="color:red">[X] </span>

The construction would be straight forward, and most parts are easily available.  Acquiring a urinal might be costly and then wasted. There is enough landfill of art that was not loved.

Art that is derivative is <<à la foi>> simplistic and boring, <<et à la foi>> smart and intelligent commentary.  This idea evokes [apathetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy) responses. (my specialty)
