## <i><span style="color:red">This Idea has been approved for failure [X] </span> </i>

# Inspiration
In the first class, at the moment I heard the words _"found object"_ my thoughts went instantly to Marcel Duchamps. People in the class might remember me smilling, and giggling like a little kid... It is true, I am like a five year old kid.


###  Examples and source for this "original" idea

Riffing off of Marcel Duchamp's "fountain" and Jaume Plensa's "Crown Fountain", the idea of a urinal pouring out at the audience seemed obvious and didn't require a lot of reflection.

# Attempts
### Initial Sketchy Ideas
 
I haven't used CAD since the 1990's and this is one of the few times I have tried to use a non-CAD tool to create a CAD object.


<img src="images/muttr-256x256.png"
     alt="Eample sketch of a urinal water fountain: Created with Apple Preview"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; "    />


I did not have a pen at the time, and I thought I would test myself to hack Apple's Preview PDF viewer to create an image. Note: there is no way to create a new image in Apple's Preview PDF viewer. I first created a screen-shot, then pasted white over everything making a 'canvas'. After that used the basic stencil tools to create the shapes.  "success".

<<Ceci n'est pas une urinoir>>.



### Things to aquire

### Urinal <span style="color:red">[X] </span>

Unfortunatly, new uruibals cost more than 100 dollars, and there in no chance I will  buy one used, to make a water fountain out of...

# Summary? ([I'm too late](#the-end))


This is how I can claim it is not my fault, someone-else had already tried it...
Someone has already though of this, the combination, toilet, bidder and water-fountain already exists.

No patent for you!

### [Why this idea was doomed to fail](#ultimate-fail) <span style="color:red">[X] </span>

The construction would be straight forward, and most parts are easily available.  Acquiring a urinal might be costly and then wasted. There is enough landfill of art that was not loved.

Art that is derivative is <<à la foi>> simplistic and boring, <<et à la foi>> smart and intelligent commentary.  This idea evokes [apathetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy) responses. (my specialty)
